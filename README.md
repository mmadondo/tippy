## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

When I did this over the summer, I encountered these challenges:
** Using the command line to access GIT. This was later explained fully in class and was able to work around it with no issues.
** Connecting constants to app, resolved by asking colleague and facilitator and learning how to ensure the control + drag properly works

When I revised this for TPM application, I had no major challenges!
